# RelentlessNight

Relentless Night is a gameplay mod for The Long Dark that introduces a new sandbox scenario where the spin of the Earth is slowing down. Slowly but surely, days and nights are getting longer over time, leading to a world with continuously changing temperatures, weather patterns, wildlife populations, and more.

As the world slows, each longer dark brings even colder temperatures to the Canadian North, the resulting temperature distributions in the atmosphere start to give way to stronger winds and blizzards, even adapted wildlife slowly start to disappear as they succumb to the worsening conditions of the cold nights.

The player, realizing what is happening, must take advantage of the longer days and the warmer temperatures to prepare for the next even longer, and colder dark. All of this eventually leads to the final challenge where all your preparation will really determine how long you survive - The planet finally slows down enough to become tidally locked with the sun, with the survivor now left in the perpetual darkness of the new “dark side of Earth”, and its ever-worsening and frigid conditions.
