# RelentlessNight

What is the Relentless Night Mod?

Relentless Night is a gameplay mod for The Long Dark that introduces a new sandbox scenario where the spin of the Earth is slowing down. Slowly but surely, days and nights are getting longer over time, leading to a world with continuously changing temperatures, weather patterns, wildlife changes, and more.

As the world slows, each longer-dark brings even colder temperatures to the Canadian North, the resulting temperature distributions in the atmosphere start to give way to stronger winds and blizzards, even adapted wildlife slowly start to disappear as they succumb to the worsening conditions of the cold nights.

The player, realizing what is happening, must take advantage of the longer days and the warmer temperatures to prepare for the next even longer, and colder, darkness. All of this eventually leads to the final challenge where all your preparation will really determine how long you survive - The planet finally slows down enough to become tidally locked with the sun, with the survivor now left in the perpetual darkness of the new “dark side of Earth”, and its ever-worsening and frigid conditions.

Relentless Night will add a progress difficulty into survival mode that at first doesn't seem any different than regular run, but the effects will slowly add up and bring about conditions that make gameplay harder. All this eventually leads to a world that's incredibly harsh and difficult to survive in for even veterans and expert survivalists of the game.

New Features in v4.0

Carcass Moving – Medium sized kills such as deer and wolves can be picked up and hauled around the game world at the cost of speed, additional fatigue, and calories burned. The carcasses can be taken indoors and between scenes. Demos Here and Here - apologies for the volume, those with headphones might want to turn it down.

Endgame Aurora – During the Relentless Night endgame, you have the ability to switch the aurora on permanently.

Electric Torch Lighting – During an aurora, you can light torches without a match directly from electric outlets and live electric cables.

Minimum Temperature Setting – Minimum temperature is now configurable within a Relentless Night run. This determines how fast temperatures drop with lengthening nights, as well as the minimum temperature possible at the end game.

Dynamic Settings - All Relentless Night settings are now dynamic and can be changed during your run. Mod settings are now placed under game Options > Mod Settings > Relentless Night Settings.

Complete List of Mod Features and Options (v4.0):

new All mod gameplay features can now be customized in game Option > Mod Settings > Relentless Night Settings.

new Electric Torch Lighting – During an aurora, you can light torches without a match directly from electric outlets and live electric cables.

new Medium sized kills such as deer and wolves can be picked up and hauled around the game world at the cost of speed, additional fatigue, and calories burned. The carcasses can be taken indoors and between scenes.

new Minimum reachable temperature is now also configurable within a Relentless Night run. This determines how fast temperatures drop with lengthening nights, as well at the minimum temperature possible at the end game.

Coals can be added to a fire without a waiting period (late-game balancing)

(optional) Indoor environments will retain heat from fires much longer after the fire has burnt out through the Heat Retention mechanic. The hotter the fire, the longer it will keep the place warm. In enclosed buildings, fires will heat the whole house/space and better insulated environments will keep warm for longer.

(optional) Outdoor Temperature will affect wildlife populations. Roaming wildlife will be less abundant and harder to find in extreme cold temperatures, but also more abundant in relatively warm temperatures.

(configurable) Ability to adjust how long fuels will burn in a fire or how long lantern fuel will last while in use. All can be adjusted to provide up to 3 times their regular burn times.

(configurable) Days and nights get increasingly longer eventually ending in the tidal locking of the Earth and survival in perpetual darkness.

(configurable) Temperatures become increasingly warmer/colder with duration of days/nights.

(configurable) Indoor temperatures can be configured to have a correlation with outdoor temperatures.

Blizzards and stronger winds become more frequent as days/nights become longer and weather becomes more extreme.

(configurable) Roaming wildlife become increasingly scarce as outdoor conditions become more extreme and harsh.

Cabin fever affliction is disabled due to the eventuality of long nights and extreme outdoor temperatures.

Indoor environments can become more lit during nights depending on weather and available moonlight outdoors. During the brightest phases of the moon, crafting/breaking of items indoors can become available again.

Surveying is now possible at night, provided the weather is clear and enough light is present.

(optional) For every additional 1C below a feels-like temperature of -40C, the rate at which the player suffers freezing damage is increased. This effect can accumulate up to a maximum of 3x the original rate at the extreme end of Relentless Night temperatures, do bring a jacket.

The mod scenario can be played in all sandbox difficulties and can be set up in its own sandbox page. The mod does not prevent playing regular sandbox or other vanilla modes. Relentless night saves are kept completely separate from other save data and cannot be played by regular sandbox mode and vice versa.

Note: Journal statistics and days survived are still tracked in regular 24-hour days, as if the player is still keeping track with a watch.
